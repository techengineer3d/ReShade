# ReShade

Presets and shaders for the reshade program at https://reshade.me/ .

## Intro

I am a long time game industry veteran game developer with a background in shading, graphics and tools programming.

After discovering reshade, the "shade anywhere" program, I tried using the existing reshade shaders to improve the overall quality and cinematic experience of my movie and game collection.

I had a great time making different shading presets, and could not believe the vast improvements that could be achieved with reshade post-fx.

In some cases, it was like watching a completely new film, or playing a high end, remastered version of a game.

I found that it looks best when viewing 4K or 8K remasters or ultra-high definition (UHD) content.


## REPO MAINTENANCE NOTICE

Due to strong changes to the reshade presets, this repo is undergoing maintenance.

It will be updated with upgraded presets and completely new screenshots.

COMING SOON !
