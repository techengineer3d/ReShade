# ReShade

Presets and shaders for the reshade program at https://reshade.me/ .

## Intro

I am a long time game industry veteran game developer with a background in shading, graphics and tools programming.

After discovering reshade, the "shade anywhere" program, I tried using the existing reshade shaders to improve the overall video quality and cinematic viewing experience of my movie collection.

I had a great time making different shading presets, and could not believe the vast improvements that could be achieved with reshade post-fx.

It was like watching a completely new film in some cases.

I found that it looks best when viewing 4K or 8K remasters or ultra-high definition (UHD) content.

I would like to share my reshade presets and setup this repository.

## Folders

"reshade-presets": reshade shader presets are located in this folder.

"reshade-shaders": reshade shader resources are located in this folder.

"readme": contains assets and images used in this repository's readme.md file.

## Presets

### TechEngineer3D-PostFX-Color-Contrast-Sharp-Bloom

This post-fx shader is for enhancing image color richness, fidelity, details, sharpness, contrast, lighting and specular highlights.

This is the result of my first post-fx shader for reshade.

After a month of experimenting and tuning parameters, I came up with the overall quality and look I was aiming for.

I have tested it with various movie scenes and am pleased with the results.

I have not tried testing this with any realtime 3D games, but since it is just post effects, it could technically work on games too.

It could probably use a little more tweaking to deal with specific scenes that have strong brightness or dark areas.

But overall, I think the results are good.

I was rather amazed at a lot of the fine details that were brought out when compared to the original movie images.

I have posted some screenshots below, showing the original image and reshaded image.

The small image preview on GitHub makes it hard to see many of the enhanced details.

I recommend to preview the images at full size, next to each other.

Better yet, just download the preset and shaders, and try viewing it in your movie player of choice.
